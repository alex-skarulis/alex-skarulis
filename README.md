## About

Healthcare AI Solutions Innovator with a unique blend of domain knowledge, analytical proficiency, programming skills, and exceptional communication abilities. With nearly 30 years of diverse experience in the healthcare industry, I've worked across Payer, Provider, Employer, Management Consulting, and Business Associate sectors.

I specialize in developing innovative AI-driven solutions to improve healthcare outcomes. My career has included roles as a Healthcare Management Consultant, Benefits Performance Consultant, Sales Solution Executive, Analytics Consultant leveraging ML and AI, and most recently, a Python OpenAI API Developer and Project Consultant.

In my current project, I’m pioneering a novel approach that integrates AI, Project Management, Healthcare Analytics, Data Science, Zettelkasten information management, and classic Role-Playing Games (RPGs). This unique methodology allows for comprehensive project planning, enhanced collaboration, and effective delivery of data-driven insights.
